# Hilbert curve and map colour
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675473/)
Thus, the darker the pixel colour appears, the higher the coverage is and vice versa.
Notably, white areas indicate zeros as coverage or absence of data as the length of a chromosome does not follow 
the required 22N length for a Hilbert curve. In the case of sequencing gaps where the coverage value is zero, 
we assign a white RGB (255 255 255) colour to the corresponding pixels.
